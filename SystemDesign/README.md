# 📘 System Design - Architect Like a Pro

Welcome to the **System Design** section of this guide! 🏗️🧠🌐  
System Design is about understanding how to build scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems. It’s a critical skill for senior developers, especially in backend and full-stack roles.

This guide helps you think like an architect — starting from fundamentals to designing large-scale distributed systems.

## 🟢 Basic Concepts 🧱📐🔍

These lay the foundation for understanding how systems work:

- What is System Design?
- Types of System Design (Low-Level vs High-Level)
- Functional vs Non-functional Requirements
- Client-Server Architecture
- IP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS Basics
- Load Balancer Basics
- Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling
- Latency vs Throughput
- Caching (Basics, Browser Cache, CDN)

---

## 🔵 Intermediate Concepts 🌐🛠️⚙️

Core building blocks for designing scalable systems:

- APIs & Microservices
- Database Design
  - SQL vs NoSQL
  - Sharding & Replication
  - CAP Theorem
- Load Balancing (Round Robin, Least Connections)
- Caching (Redis, Memcached)
- Rate Limiting
- Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- File Storage (Object Stores like S3)
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Consistent Hashing
- Data Partitioning

## 🔴 Advanced Concepts 🚀📊📡

Deep-level concepts to build systems like Instagram, WhatsApp, or YouTube:

- System Design Interviews (Approach, Clarifications, Trade-offs)
- Designing Large-Scale Systems
  - URL Shortener (e.g., TinyURL)
  - Rate Limiter
  - Messaging System (e.g., WhatsApp)
  - Feed System (e.g., Facebook)
  - File Sharing System (e.g., Dropbox)
  - Video Streaming (e.g., YouTube)
  - Uber, Google Maps (Real-time Systems)
- Consistency & Availability
  - Strong vs Eventual Consistency
  - Quorum
- Distributed Systems
  - Leader Election
  - Consensus Algorithms (Paxos, Raft)
- Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting
- Disaster Recovery
- Security in System Design

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies 🛠️🧪🔧

- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB
- Caching: Redis, Memcached
- Queues: Kafka, RabbitMQ
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- Infra: Nginx, HAProxy, Docker, Kubernetes
