# 📘 SQL - Mastering Structured Query Language

Welcome to the **SQL** section of this guide! SQL (Structured Query Language) is the backbone of data storage, access, and manipulation in relational databases. 💾📊🛠️

Whether you're building web apps, analyzing data, or preparing for backend development interviews, a strong grasp of SQL is essential. This guide will take you from the very basics to advanced-level queries and optimization techniques. 🧠🚀🔥

## 🟢 Basic Topics 🧑‍💻📗🌱

These topics help you understand how SQL works and how to use it to interact with databases:

- What is SQL? Overview and Use Cases
- Introduction to Relational Databases
- SQL Syntax and Case Sensitivity
- Basic SQL Statements:
  - `SELECT`, `FROM`
  - `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
  - `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`
- Filtering Data (`=`, `>`, `<`, `!=`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`)
- Sorting Data (`ASC`, `DESC`)
- Basic `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- NULL Handling and `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`
- Aggregate Functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
- Aliases using `AS`
- Basic `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- Basic Table Creation and Data Types

## 🔵 Intermediate Topics ⚙️📘🔍

This level focuses on relationships, efficiency, and slightly complex logic:

- Data Types Deep Dive (INT, VARCHAR, TEXT, DATE, etc.)
- Table Relationships: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many
- Foreign Keys and Referential Integrity
- JOIN Operations:
  - `INNER JOIN`
  - `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
  - `FULL OUTER JOIN`
  - `CROSS JOIN`
- UNION vs UNION ALL
- Subqueries (in `WHERE`, `FROM`, and `SELECT`)
- EXISTS and NOT EXISTS
- CASE Statements
- Indexes: What and Why
- Views and Materialized Views
- Basic Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT)
- Transactions: `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`

## 🔴 Advanced Topics 🔥📦💡

Master these to handle large-scale applications and optimize your SQL like a pro:

- Stored Procedures & Functions
- Triggers and Automation
- Window Functions:
  - `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`
  - `LEAD()`, `LAG()`, `NTILE()`, `PARTITION BY`
- Complex Subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Recursive CTEs
- Pivot and Unpivot Data
- Query Optimization and EXPLAIN Plans
- Indexing Strategy and Performance Tuning
- Transactions and Isolation Levels (ACID)
- Locks and Deadlocks
- Data Migration and Backup Strategies
- Role Management and Permissions (GRANT, REVOKE)
- Handling Big Data with SQL Engines (e.g., BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake)
- NoSQL vs SQL Comparison for Architects
