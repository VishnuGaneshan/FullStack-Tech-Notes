# 📘 TypeScript - Typed Superset of JavaScript

Welcome to the **TypeScript** section of this guide! TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers powerful tooling, early error detection, and improved developer experience by adding type safety and modern features on top of JavaScript.

Whether you're building frontend apps with React, backend APIs with Node.js, or large-scale full-stack applications, TypeScript helps you write clean, predictable, and scalable code. 📐🚀🧠

This guide will walk you through everything — from fundamentals to advanced type magic.

## ✅ **Basic Topics** ✨📘🧩

These topics cover the core syntax and features TypeScript adds to JavaScript:

- What is TypeScript and Why Use It
- Installing & Setting Up TypeScript
- TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`) & Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
- Basic Types:
  - `number`, `string`, `boolean`
  - `any`, `unknown`, `void`, `null`, `undefined`, `never`
- Type Annotations vs Type Inference
- Arrays and Tuples
- Enums
- Type Aliases
- Union and Intersection Types
- Literal Types
- `const` vs `let` with types

## 🚀 **Intermediate Topics** 📦⚙️📚

These are essential to build scalable, maintainable, and clean applications:

- Interfaces
- Optional & Readonly Properties
- Functions:
  - Function Types
  - Optional and Default Parameters
  - Rest Parameters
- Type Assertions
- Working with Objects
- Narrowing (Type Guards)
- Type Compatibility
- Utility Types:
  - `Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Readonly`, etc.
- Working with DOM and Event Handling in TS
- TypeScript with Classes & Inheritance
- `this` in TypeScript Context

---

## 🧠 **Advanced Topics** 🧠💡📐

These take you deeper into mastering TypeScript’s type system and writing safe, complex applications:

- Advanced Types:
  - Mapped Types
  - Conditional Types
  - Indexed Access Types
  - Template Literal Types
- Generics:
  - Generic Functions
  - Generic Interfaces
  - Generic Constraints
- Declaration Files (`.d.ts`)
- Modules and Namespaces
- Type Operators: `keyof`, `typeof`, `in`, `infer`
- Discriminated Unions
- Recursive Types
- Handling `this` in Different Contexts
- TypeScript with React (JSX/TSX & Props Typing)
- Working with 3rd Party Libraries (`@types`)
- Configuring `tsconfig.json` for Real-World Projects
- Type Checking vs Runtime Checking
- Best Practices & Clean Code with TypeScript
