# 📘 Node.js - JavaScript on the Server Side

Welcome to the **Node.js** section of this guide! Node.js is a powerful, open-source runtime that lets you execute JavaScript code outside the browser. It’s designed for building scalable network applications and is the backbone of modern web backends and full-stack JavaScript development. ⚙️🌐⚡

With a fast event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O, Node.js is perfect for creating real-time apps, RESTful APIs, command-line tools, and more.

This guide will take you from understanding how Node works under the hood to building advanced backends and APIs. 🌲🛠️💡
